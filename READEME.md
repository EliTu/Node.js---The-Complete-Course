# Node.js - The Complete Guide

## About

This is the repo for Maximilian Schwartzmuller's backend development course for JavaScript developers. While the main focus is on learning the theory and practice behind Node.js and Express to create a server that can serve static files, there are other useful topics for all-around backend development, such as: databases (SQL and NoSQL - with focus on MongoDB and Mongoose), authentication, validation, encryption, email handling, cookies & sessions, file uploads, Stripe API for payments, building REST API, GraphQL and more.

While the repo follows the course content, much of the actual code implementation is different than the course's implementation, as I like to code things in my way and experiment with the new found knowledge.

## TypeScript

From Section 22 I've added a major refactor: the app is now moved to use TypeScript and supports full typing for all the functions, models, controllers etc.

## Credit

Credit for the amazing and insightful course goes to Maximilian Schwartzmuler. Keep being awesome Max!
